# Project Name:  CLDV_FunctionsüçΩÔ∏è

## Overview: üìÉ
This project contains Azure Funcitions that both get and post information to Azure Storage Services. These functions will soon be integrated into my Part 1 and soon I will 
have an MVC project that utilizes Azure Functions for uploading and gathering data from Table, Blob, Queue and FileShare Services.

## Technology Used: üíª
I made use of a C# in Azure Functions. This proved to be a learning experience as it was my first time utilizing Http triggers and coding api's. 
Visual studio code is also very accomodating to git, so my entire project experience from start to finish operated quite smoothly.

## Challenges Encountered üõ†Ô∏è
###Limited resources
I found majority of this projected to be researching on how to go about creating and connecting functions to the various azure services.
The lack of resources around this topic proved challenging, however with the few at my disposal, i managed to create working functions that pull and post
information reliably to azure storage services.

###Code Minipulation:
For this part I had to make use of my Part 1's code. This proved difficult as MVC and Azure Functions are different in their methods of writing information to and from Azure.
At the end of the project I found changing the code over from my Part 1 to be relatively easy and allowed for me to comfortably and reliably complete my project.
## Future Plans: ‚úàÔ∏è
I hope to integrate my functions with my Part 1 of my POE. Integrating the functions with the MVC may prove challenging but I feel ready for a challenge.

## To download the project: üì•
1) Select the code button on the home page.
2) Select the option 'Download ZIP' in the bottom left corner.
(The file will then be downloaded onto your device.)
3) Next you will want to launch 'Visual Studio Code 2022'.
4) Select the option to load a project and select the ZIP file dowmloaded from GIT.
5) Next the project should load and run!

## How to use the project: üåê 
1) Firstly, you will need to run the application and have the console appear with the api links.
2) You will then copy the link of the function you would like to have execute.
3) Paste the link into postman or into your web browser url.
4) If using postman, ensure you utilize the correct keys and upload the correct file type with regards to blob and file share services.
5) When using the browser paste the link and the function will run as intended with no input needed from the user.
